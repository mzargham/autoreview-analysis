Mediated by adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1 receptors, this polypeptide stimulates [[adenylate cyclase]] and subsequently increases the [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] level in target cells. Adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1 not only is a hypophysiotropic hormone (i.e. a substance that induces activity in the [[pituitary gland|hypophysis]]), but also functions as a [[neurotransmitter]] and [[neuromodulation|neuromodulator]]. In addition, it plays a role in [[paracrine]] and [[autocrine]] regulation of certain types of cells. This gene has five [[exon]]s. Exons 1 and 2 encode the [[5' UTR]] and [[signal peptide]], respectively; exon 4 encodes an adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 1-related peptide; and exon 5 encodes the mature peptide and [[3' UTR]]. This gene encodes three different mature peptides, including two isotypes: a shorter form and a longer form.&lt;ref name=&quot;entrez&quot;/&gt;</p>\\n<p>A version of this gene has been associated with [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) in women (but not men).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ressler 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ressler KJ, Mercer KB, Bradley B, Jovanovic T, Mahan A, Kerley K, Norrholm SD, Kilaru V, Smith AK, Myers AJ, Ramirez M, Engel A, Hammack SE, Toufexis D, Braas KM, Binder EB, May V | display-authors = 6 | title = Post-traumatic stress disorder is associated with pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and the PAC1 receptor | journal = Nature | volume = 470 | issue = 7335 | pages = 492–7 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21350482 | pmc = 3046811 | doi = 10.1038/nature09856 | bibcode = 2011Natur.470..492R }}&lt;/ref&gt; This disorder involves a maladaptive psychological response to traumatic, i.e. existence-threatening, events.

       "  'content': 'The ADCYAP1 gene encodes the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), which is a neuropeptide with a broad range of functions in cell signaling and organismal physiology. PACAP is involved in the regulation of gonadotropin biosynthesis and secretion, acting both independently and in conjunction with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GNRH). It stimulates the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by activating the cAMP/protein kinase A signaling pathway in pituitary cells. This activation enhances the expression of several genes in gonadotropes, including those for the alpha subunit of gonadotropins, LH beta, FSH beta, and the GNRH receptor (Thomas2013GATA).  Additionally, PACAP plays a significant role in nerve regeneration and cellular communication. It is expressed in medium-sized DRG neurons and is upregulated during the regenerative process following nerve injury. PACAP enhances neurite outgrowth in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons, indicating its role in promoting neural health and recovery (Baskozos2020Molecular).  In the context of metabolic regulation, PACAP influences insulin secretion and overall energy homeostasis. It is crucial for stimulating insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, particularly significant in pancreatic islet actions and mechanisms (Gu2002Genetic). This multifaceted peptide thus plays critical roles in hormonal regulation, nerve regeneration, and metabolic processes, impacting various physiological outcomes in human health.',\n",

       "  'content': \"ADCYAP1, also known as adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide 1, has been implicated in various clinical conditions primarily related to its role in stress responses and metabolic regulation. Variations in the ADCYAP1 gene, particularly the rs2267735 SNP, have been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in females. This SNP, located in a putative estrogen response element of the ADCYAP1R1 gene, correlates with PTSD diagnosis and symptoms, including impaired fear discrimination and increased startle responses in dark conditions (Ressler2011Post-traumatic). Methylation of the ADCYAP1R1 gene, which affects gene expression, has also been associated with PTSD symptoms, suggesting that epigenetic modifications play a significant role in the gene's function in stress response (Ressler2011Post-traumatic; NÃ¶thling2021Genome-wide).  In addition to its association with PTSD, ADCYAP1 has been studied in the context of metabolic disorders. Genetic variations in ADCYAP1 have been screened in type 2 diabetic patients, although findings have shown no significant transmission distortion of these variations in families (Gu2002Genetic). Furthermore, studies in mice have demonstrated that deficiency in ADCYAP1 leads to hypoinsulinemia, increased insulin sensitivity, and altered body weight and adipose tissue mass, indicating its potential role in energy metabolism and obesity (Tomimoto2008Markedly).  These findings underscore the clinical significance of ADCYAP1 in both neuropsychiatric and metabolic conditions, highlighting its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions in these areas.\",\n",

This protein functions as a neuropeptide and growth factor, influencing numerous physiological processes including neurodevelopment, neuroprotection, memory, and learning. PACAP is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems and is also found in various peripheral organs. The protein interacts with specific high-affinity receptors, leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase and the production of cyclic AMP, an important second messenger in cellular signaling pathways (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP). The gene and its protein product are crucial in the study of neurological disorders, metabolic regulation, and reproductive functions, making it a significant focus in both basic and clinical research (Ressler2011Post-traumatic; Gu2002Genetic).',\n",

       "  'content': \"ADCYAP1, encoded by the Adcyap1 gene, interacts with various proteins that play significant roles in biological and psychiatric contexts. One of the primary interactions is with adenylate cyclase, specifically the isoform ADCY7, which is crucial for the conversion of ATP to cAMP, a key signaling molecule in many cellular processes (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP). Additionally, ADCYAP1 is involved in a network of protein-protein interactions with kinases such as GSK3B, PIK3CA, SGK3, and AMPK, which are integral to signaling pathways associated with neuronal survival and psychiatric disorders such as major depression (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP).  The protein also forms part of a transcriptional regulatory network, where it interacts with other gene products. This network includes feed-forward loops and regulatory motifs that are essential for understanding the functional dynamics of these proteins in psychiatric disorders (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP). Furthermore, ADCYAP1's interactions extend to the transcriptional level, where it is co-regulated with other genes, suggesting potential transcriptional regulatory relationships or direct regulation by shared factors (Acquaah-Mensah2012PACAP).  These interactions highlight the multifunctional role of ADCYAP1 in cellular signaling and regulation, underscoring its importance in both normal physiological processes and in the pathology of various disorders.\",\n",

Two different phenotypes have been observed. One form of the disorder presented as [[vascular strokes]], [[lactic acidosis]], [[cardiomyopathy]] and cataracts, abnormal muscle cell histopathology and mitochondrial function. In those patients, there was also a markedly high rate of citrate synthase. The second phenotype presented with similar clinical symptoms, but no strokes. As phosphatidic acid is also involved in the synthesis of [[phospholipids]], its loss will result in changes to the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane. These effects manifest as cataract formation in the eye, respiratory chain dysfunction and cardiac hypertrophy in heart tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Siriwardena K, Mackay N, Levandovskiy V, Blaser S, Raiman J, Kantor PF, Ackerley C, Robinson BH, Schulze A, Cameron JM | title = Mitochondrial citrate synthase crystals: novel finding in Sengers syndrome caused by acylglycerol kinase (AGK) mutations | journal = Molecular Genetics and Metabolism | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 40–50 | date = Jan 2013 | pmid = 23266196 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymgme.2012.11.282 }}&lt;/ref&gt;</p>\\n<p>AGK expression has also been correlated with certain [[cancer]] phenotypes. AGK expression, in coordination with AGX, was not detected in non-neoplastic epithelia, while both were weakly expressed in the majority of high-grade intra-epithelial neoplasia (HG-PIN).

       "  'content': 'Mutations in the AGK gene are primarily associated with Sengers syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by congenital cataracts, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, and lactic acidosis. Studies have identified specific mutations such as a homozygous mutation (c.3G>A, p.M1I) and a stop mutation (c.979A>T, p.K327*) that lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, impacting mitochondrial structure and the activities of mitochondrial complexes I, III, and IV. This dysfunction manifests clinically with symptoms like cataract formation, respiratory chain dysfunction, and cardiac hypertrophy (Siriwardena2013Mitochondrial).  Beyond Sengers syndrome, alterations in AGK expression have been implicated in various cancers. Overexpression of AGK in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is linked to increased tumor size and tumorigenesis, partly through enhanced JAK2/STAT3 signaling and an increase in the cancer stem cell population (Chen2013Acylglycerol). Similarly, AGK is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, where it promotes angiogenesis and inhibits apoptosis, contributing to poorer patient outcomes (Cui2014AGK).  Additionally, AGK-BRAF gene fusion has been identified in certain cancers, such as myoepithelial carcinoma and pediatric papillary thyroid carcinoma. This fusion is associated with aggressive tumor behavior and resistance to conventional therapies, highlighting a potential target for therapeutic intervention (DOMEN2021Excellent; Sisdelli2019AGKâ\\x80\\x90BRAF).',\n",

The protein also features an N-terminal Î±1 helix that anchors it to the membrane, and a C-terminal region that includes an additional membrane anchor helix loop, suggesting its association with the membrane (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).  AGK is integrated into the mitochondrial inner membrane, oriented with its large C-terminal domain towards the intermembrane space, and is a subunit of the human TIM22 complex, indicating a role in mitochondrial protein transport (Kang2017Sengers). This structural arrangement supports its function in the import and assembly of mitochondrial carrier proteins, independent of its kinase activity (Kang2017Sengers).  Details on the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of AGK, as well as specific domains other than the DGK domains, prominent folds, post-translational modifications, or splice variant isoforms, are not provided in the available literature. Thus, further studies are needed to elucidate these aspects of the AGK protein structure.',\n",

In the context of gastric cancer, AGK interacts with YAP1 and TEAD transcription factors, forming a complex that binds to TEAD response elements (TREs) on the AGK promoter, thereby regulating AGK transcription and enhancing the expression of downstream genes in the Hippo-YAP1 pathway (Huang2020Upâ\\x80\\x90regulated). This interaction suggests a reciprocal regulatory mechanism where AGK not only is a target but also stimulates the transcriptional activity of the YAP1/TEAD complex, creating a positive feedback loop in cancer progression (Huang2020Upâ\\x80\\x90regulated).  In mitochondrial function, AGK is a component of the TIM22 complex, crucial for the insertion of metabolite carriers into the mitochondrial inner membrane. AGK binds specifically with TIMM22 and TIMM29, integral parts of the TIM22 complex, playing a role in the structural and functional dynamics of the mitochondrial inner membrane (Vukotic2017Acylglycerol). Additionally, AGK interacts with ribosomal protein L39 (RPL39) in ovarian cancer cells, influencing mitochondrial function and impacting cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic resistance (Sun2022Acylglycerol). These interactions highlight AGK's role in both cancer progression and mitochondrial dynamics, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target.\",\n",

These molecules play crucial roles in cellular processes including membrane biosynthesis and signal transduction (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization). The AGK protein is also integral to mitochondrial health, participating in the synthesis of cardiolipin, a lipid essential for the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and serving a structural role in the TIM22 complex, which is vital for the import of proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization). Structurally, AGK is a membrane-associated protein with specific domains that anchor it to the mitochondrial membrane, reflecting its multifunctional roles in cellular metabolism and mitochondrial dynamics (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).',\n",

These lipids are vital for phospholipid synthesis, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial structure and function (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization). In mitochondria, AGK is involved in the synthesis of cardiolipin, a specific phospholipid necessary for the proper function of the electron transport chain and protein import machinery within the inner mitochondrial membrane (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).  Additionally, AGK serves a kinase-independent role as a subunit of the TIM22 complex, a mitochondrial translocase that is crucial for the stability and import of mitochondrial carrier proteins into the mitochondrial inner membrane. This complex facilitates the translocation of proteins with internal targeting signals into the inner mitochondrial membrane, underscoring AGK's role in mitochondrial protein import (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).  Beyond its enzymatic activity, AGK also helps in scavenging mitochondrial diacylglycerol, which is important for controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling through a pathway mediated by protein kinase D1, highlighting its role in cellular signaling and oxidative stress management (Barbosa-Gouveia2021Characterization).\",\n",

The ATF1 protein plays a pivotal role in cellular processes by regulating gene expression in response to various physiological and stress-related signals. It is characterized by a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, essential for DNA binding and dimerization, allowing it to interact with other transcription factors and coactivators to modulate gene expression dynamically (SansoÌ\\x812008Transcription; Hai2001The). ATF1 is involved in several critical cellular pathways, including those activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and is implicated in the phosphorylation-dependent regulation of genes such as c-jun, which is crucial for cell proliferation and survival (Gupta2002ATF1). Additionally, ATF1's role extends to interactions with proteins like BRCA1 and involvement in chromosomal translocations in certain cancers, highlighting its significance in both normal cellular function and disease (Houvras2000BRCA1).\",\n",

One of the key interactions is with PIAS3, which modulates ATF1's activity by inhibiting its binding to the antioxidant-responsive element (ARE) of the human ferritin H gene, thereby influencing gene expression (Iwasaki2007PIAS3). Additionally, ATF1 forms a complex with the APC/C ubiquitin ligase through Apc5 in fission yeast, which is crucial for the function of the APC/C ubiquitin ligase, enhancing its ubiquitylation activity (Ors2009The).  ATF1 also interacts with BRCA1 through the RING finger motif of BRCA1 and the basic zipper DNA-binding domain of ATF1. This interaction enhances the transcriptional activity of ATF1, particularly under conditions involving DNA damage (Houvras2000BRCA1). Furthermore, ATF1 is involved in stress response mechanisms where it interacts with Fbh1, part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. Phosphorylation of ATF1, influenced by stress-induced activation of the Sty1 MAP kinase, modulates this interaction, crucial for regulating ATF1 levels under stress conditions (Lawrence2009Stress-Induced).  These interactions highlight ATF1's role in regulating various cellular processes through its involvement in multiple protein complexes and its ability to respond to cellular signals.\",\n",

       "  'content': 'ATF1 (Activating Transcription Factor 1) is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression in response to various cellular signals, including epidermal growth factor (EGF). It is involved in the signaling pathways activated by EGF, particularly focusing on the expression of the protooncogene c-jun. ATF1 is phosphorylated by the ERK MAPK pathway, a process essential for the EGF-induced expression of c-jun. This phosphorylation event is a critical step in the activation of the c-jun promoter, which is further influenced by the cooperation of the ERK and JNK pathways (Gupta2002ATF1).  In addition to its role in response to EGF, ATF1 also interacts with other transcription factors like CREB and is involved in the binding to coactivators such as the CREB-binding protein. This indicates its broader role in transcriptional regulation (Gupta2002ATF1). ATF1 can form homodimers or heterodimers with CREB, and both proteins are phosphorylated at conserved protein kinase A sites, which are also targets for phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases. This phosphorylation facilitates the interaction of CREB/ATF1 with transcriptional coactivators such as CBP and p300, enhancing their transcriptional activity (Houvras2000BRCA1).  ATF1 is also implicated in chromosomal translocations in certain cancers and may be targeted for mutation in some breast or ovarian cancers, similar to other proteins that interact with BRCA1, highlighting its significance in cellular health and disease (Houvras2000BRCA1).',\n",

       "  'content': 'ATF1 (Activating Transcription Factor 1) is implicated in various cancers and other diseases through mutations, altered expression levels, and disruptions in its normal interactions. In colorectal cancer (CRC), ATF1 is overexpressed and linked to the activation of genes involved in critical pathways such as apoptosis, Wnt, TGF-beta, and MAPK, which contribute to cell proliferation and tumor growth. Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ATF1 enhance its expression through promoter-enhancer interactions mediated by transcription factors SP1 and GATA3, predisposing individuals to CRC (Tian2019Systematic).  In the context of soft tissue tumors, ATF1 is part of the EWSR1-ATF1 fusion gene found in clear cell sarcoma, acting as a tumor promoter by producing a chimeric protein that transactivates genes in a cAMP-independent manner, leading to dysregulation of genes controlled by CREB1/ATF and promoting the melanocytic phenotype and growth of tumor cells (Thway2012Tumors).  Furthermore, ATF1 has been associated with essential hypertension (EH) in the Northeastern Han Chinese population. A mutation in the ATF1 gene affects the binding of microRNAs, leading to altered expression levels and increasing the risk of EH (Yang2015The). These findings underscore the diverse roles of ATF1 in human diseases and highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.',\n",

This domain is common among several transcription factors and is essential for the protein's function in transcriptional regulation (SansoÌ\\x812008Transcription; Hai2001The). The molecular structure of ATF1 includes a DNA-binding domain (bZIP) and a transactivation domain, which are separated by an intermediate domain rich in positively charged amino acids. This arrangement suggests that phosphorylation of the transactivation domain, which contains multiple phosphorylation sites, does not impair the DNA-binding capacity of ATF1 but may enhance transcription initiation by facilitating the recruitment of other transcriptional machinery (Salat-Canela2017Deciphering).  ATF1 undergoes significant post-translational modifications, notably phosphorylation, which plays a critical role in its functional regulation. The phosphorylation sites identified include Ser152, Ser172, Thr204, Thr216, Ser226, and Thr249, and mutations at these sites can render the protein inactive, highlighting their importance for ATF1's activity (Salat-Canela2017Deciphering).  While the primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of ATF1 are not detailed in the provided excerpts, the information underscores the significance of the bZIP domain and phosphorylation in the protein's function and stability.\",\n",
